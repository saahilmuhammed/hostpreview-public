HostPreview (vibe‑coded) is a modern web proxy tool for previewing websites against any backend IP without touching DNS or local hosts files. It lets you map domain → IP → protocol → path on the fly, then spins up a live, sandboxed preview with asset rewriting, SSL fallback, and shareable preview URLs. The interface is fully vibe‑coded: a dark, dashboard‑style workspace with real‑time status, connection details, and a live preview pane designed for ops teams, hosting providers, and developers shipping migrations with confidence.
