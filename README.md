HostPreview (vibe‑coded) is a modern web proxy tool for previewing websites against any backend IP without touching DNS or local hosts files. It lets you map domain → IP → protocol → path on the fly, then spins up a live, sandboxed preview with asset rewriting, SSL fallback, and shareable preview URLs. The interface is fully vibe‑coded.  A live preview for ops teams, hosting providers, and developers shipping migrations with confidence.

### Prerequisites
- Git
